Summary of codebase
Using Github Copilot - Claude Sonnet 3.7

After reviewing your Blazor and Cosmos DB project, I've gained a good understanding of its structure and functionality. Here are some suggestions for improvements:

1. Configuration Management
Issue: The EngineerService class has hardcoded connection strings and database names. The EngineerServiceEfCore implementation is properly using dependency injection but is currently commented out in Program.cs.

Suggestion: Move all configuration to appsettings.json and access it through the configuration system.

2. Error Handling and Logging
Issue: The current error handling in the services is basicâ€”most methods simply catch exceptions and rethrow them with a generic message.

Suggestion: Implement proper logging using ILogger and more specific exception handling that provides meaningful error messages to users.

3. Data Validation
Issue: There's no validation on the Engineer model properties. Fields like Name, Country, and Specialty could accept empty strings or invalid values.

Suggestion: Add data annotations to the Engineer model and implement form validation in the Blazor pages.

4. Code Organization and Consistency
Issue: You have two implementations of IEngineerService: EngineerService (direct SDK) and EngineerServiceEfCore (EF Core), but only one is active.

Suggestion: Either remove the unused implementation or provide a configuration toggle to choose between them.

5. Performance Optimizations
Issue: The CosmosClient is being created for each operation in the EngineerService class, which is inefficient.

Suggestion: Make CosmosClient a singleton that's injected through dependency injection.

6. UI/UX Improvements
Issue: The UI is functional but basic, without confirmation dialogs for delete actions or loading states for async operations.

Suggestion: Add confirmation dialogs for destructive actions and improve visual feedback during loading states.

7. Repository Pattern Implementation
Issue: The service classes mix business logic and data access concerns.

Suggestion: Consider implementing a repository pattern to separate data access from business logic.

8. Pagination Support
Issue: The GetEngineerDetails method loads all engineers at once, which could cause performance issues with larger datasets.

Suggestion: Implement pagination for better performance with larger datasets.

9. Unit Tests
Issue: There don't appear to be any unit tests in the project.

10. Security Concerns
Issue: The connection strings and keys are stored directly in the configuration.
